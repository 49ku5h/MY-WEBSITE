People have turning points of their life .The point that change their whole life ,may update or degrade their life. Although my opposite is from all these people, these people have turning point but I have turnig faces in life.
That had changed me a lot for not so long ya but for a specific period of time. That,s why I have turnig faces. All those  faces taught me a lot. Like these faces had changed my way of thinking , changed my way of seeing things .
These faces had given me diffrent kind of experiences. These faces taught me life is not so simple as we of think. Life give us a lot of oppotunities now it's up to us whether we grab it or leave it.

So let's have look on different faces that turns my life

> ## First Face :A face that changed and create a Vision of my Life .

This is the time when I was in class 10 . Almost my begning of class 10. Like all Indian parent ,my parent also worried about my BOARDS ,but I am ofcourse notüòÇÔ∏è  bacause I am very chilled out guy since my childhood .
Because of my chilled out attitude my parent enrolled me in a coaching class where I met a guy who had specs on his pimpled face and wore a simple t-shirt and jeans under it like a nerd.He was from Hindi medium and I was from english medium.
I used to thought that hindi medium student are so weak as compared to english medium but he proved me wrong. That day I learned "Don't judge a book by it's cover".

Somewhere I also influced him. We started talking. when I got to know he is muslim I thought our friendship won't last long because I am jain.But when I got know him well,I came to know I most happy with him after my family.
After all this I got to know there is only one religion the religion of humanity.

We never had a conversation about ourselves. But one day I was so curious get to know about him like his family or other things . So he told me that his family consists of five members including him. His mother, father and the rest are his two sisters.
He is second among all his siblings. His father is a government employee. And he himself works as a computer technician in a computer accessories shop..He used to live a Dorm which is placed in our town.On this I questioned him Why did you live in dorm when you have your own house in this town.
So he answered me by saying the people who are staying here are like me not from so good financial background.But still happy and happy with theirs life.All these things of these people motivated me.
After this converstion I felt so much motivated and I got little bit jealous beacause despite of my financial background being good I am stil not so happy to my ongoing life.And I got to know that our financial status,family status doesn't matters,
matters what, what we thought ,what is the vision of our life.

This cycle of getting motivated continues from time to time till to end of my 12th board class. After 12th I came out for completing my higher studies Saying it's sad he's not beacause of some reasons.
But the cycle of learning something new continued. He is still my mentor and always will.be

This was the most important face of my life . Life and he taught me lots of new things. This face brought me towards a new morning of  my life.
This face taught me the experience of living life in a short period of  time.
