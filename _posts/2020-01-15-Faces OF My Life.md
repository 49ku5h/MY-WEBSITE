People have turning points in their life. The point that changes their whole life, may update or degrade their life. Although my opposite is from all these people, these people have a turning point but I have turning faces in life.
That had changed me a lot for not so long ya but for a specific period of time. That,s why I have turning faces. All those faces taught me a lot. Like these faces had changed my way of thinking, changed my way of seeing things.
These faces had given me different kinds of experiences. These faces taught me life is not so simple as we of think. Life gives us a lot of opportunities now it's up to us whether we grab it or leave it.
Each of these faces of my life gives me new experiences and opportunities.

So let's have look at different faces that turns my life...

> ## First Face: A face that has changed me and creates a Vision of my Life.

This is the time when I was in class 10. Almost my beginning of class 10. Like all Indian parents, my parents also worried about my BOARDS, but I am of course notüòÇÔ∏è  because I am a very chilled out guy since my childhood.
Because of my chilled out attitude, my parents enrolled me in a coaching class where I met a guy who had specs on his pimpled face and wore a simple t-shirt and jeans under it like a nerd. He was from the Hindi medium and I was from the English medium.
I used to thought that Hindi medium students are so weak as compared to English medium but he proved me wrong. That day I learned the real meaning of this idiom "Don't judge a book by its cover".

Somewhere I also influenced him. We started talking. when I got to know he is Muslim I thought our friendship won't last long because I am Jain. But when I got to know him well, I came to know I most happy with him after my family.
After all this, I got to know there is only one religion, the religion of humanity.

We never had a conversation about ourselves. But one day I was so curious to get to know about him like his family or other things. So he told me that his family consists of five members including him. His mother, father and the rest are his two sisters.
He is second among all his siblings. His father is a government employee. And he works as a computer technician in a computer accessories shop. He used to live in a Dorm which is placed in our town. On this, I questioned him Why did you live in a dorm when you have your own house in this town.
So he answered me by saying the people who are staying here are like me not from so good financial background. But still happy and happy with their life. All these things of these people motivated me.
After this conversation, I felt so much motivated and I got a little bit jealous because despite of my financial background being good I am still not so happy to my ongoing life. And I got to know that our financial status, family status doesn't matter,
matters what, what we thought, what is the vision of our life.

This cycle of getting motivated continues from time to time till to end of my 12th board class. After 12th I came out for completing my higher studies, saying, sadly, he's not because of some reason.
But the cycle of learning something new continued. He is still my mentor and always will.be

This was the most important face of my life. Life and he taught me lots of new things. This face brought me towards a new morning of my life.
This face taught me the experience of living life in a short period of time.
