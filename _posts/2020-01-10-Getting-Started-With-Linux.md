Switching To Linux..
How I got introduced with LINUX ...
When I started using  WINDOWS operating system. It's been awhile after using windows for few days I've heard about Linux operating system . Well i came to know much interesting stuffs about LINUX, First of all i'd love to mention that it's OPEN SOURCE most secure and snug operating system.
'SHELL' is a program which takes command through keyboard and passes to the operating system(the Linux command interpreter). Almost all Linux distributions supply a shell program from the GNU Project called bash.
When we use Graphical UI(USER INTERFACE), we need a program called TERMINAl. Most extraordinarily thing i've liked in Linux. Terminal lets you keep afar to mouse.
